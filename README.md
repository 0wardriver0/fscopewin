   ```

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start (Recommended)

Use the convenience script that handles everything:

```bash
./run.sh
```

### Manual Method

1. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Run the system monitor:

   ```bash
   ./sysmon.py
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python3 sysmon.py
   ```

3. Deactivate when done:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

**Press `Ctrl+C` to exit the monitor**

### 🎮 Keyboard Controls

- **`K`** - Enter process kill mode
- **`↑/↓`** - Navigate through processes (when in kill mode)
- **`K`** - Kill selected process (when in kill mode)
- **`Y`** - Confirm process kill
- **`N`** or **`Esc`** - Cancel process kill/exit kill mode
- **`Ctrl+C`** - Exit the application

## 📋 Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **NVIDIA drivers** (optional, for GPU monitoring)
- Terminal with Unicode support for best visual experience

## 📦 Dependencies

- `rich` - Beautiful terminal UI and formatting
- `psutil` - System and process monitoring
- `pynvml` - NVIDIA GPU monitoring (optional)
- `asyncio-throttle` - Async utilities

## 🎨 Visual Design

The interface features:

- **Matrix-style green theme** for that authentic hacker aesthetic
- **ASCII art header** with the tool name
- **Color-coded metrics** (green = good, yellow = warning, red = critical)
- **Unicode symbols and emojis** for visual clarity
- **Clean panel layout** that scales to your terminal size

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### GPU Monitoring Not Working

- Ensure NVIDIA drivers are installed
- Install `nvidia-ml-py3`: `pip3 install pynvml`
- The tool will gracefully fall back if GPU monitoring fails

### Permission Errors

- Some system metrics may require elevated permissions
- Try running with `sudo` if you encounter permission issues

### Terminal Display Issues

- Ensure your terminal supports Unicode characters
- Use a modern terminal emulator for best results
- Resize your terminal if the layout appears cramped
